# 1 - Setup


## 1.1 Fork and clone

One person in your group should fork this repository and make the other(s) in the group collaborators.

You can choose to work on one computer together (pair-programming) in which case you make one clone of your fork.

Or you can choose to both make clones of your 1 fork and work on two computers so you both can try out different things. If you choose this way, make sure to still communicatate and work as a team.

### 1.2 Familiarize yourselves

- Open the source code and browse around
- Look at `package.json`
	- What dependencies and dev-dependencies are there?
	- What command is probably used to start this project for local development?
	- Start it for local development by running:
		npm install
		npm ...?
- Have a look at the project in your browser to see what it's all about.
- Also take a look at `webpack.config.js` to see how webpack is configured for this project.

If you've managed to get the app started locally and it seems to work in your browser, continue to the next step. If you're having problems, ask a classmate or teacher.
