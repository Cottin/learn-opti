# Basic optimization with Webpack and React 
In this lab, we look at ways of optimizing a basic js / react application using webpack.

The data in this lab is taken from [https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators)

## Instructions
Work in groups of 2 and follow the instructions below step by step and write down answers to any questions marked with a üê´ in the file readme file itself. These questions will be discussed during class. Once you reach this symbol :metal: wait for the rest of the class to get there and we'll do a walk through together. While you wait, there are some extra questions that you can do market with _"Extra"_.


## What we'll learn

- Bundle analyzing
- Seperate dev/prod webpack configs
- Tree shaking
- Uglification and minimization
- Source mapping
- Code splitting
- Optimization in react 

## Hand in

There will not be any hand in, this is a classroom exercise so just make a good effort to solve the problems and learn stuff :)
